Caret is a powerful code editor that combines simplicity with advanced features that developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

Caret is updated regularly with new features and bug fixes. You can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
